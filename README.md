This is a simple collection of inter related classes to deal with numbers with units attached.

For example, this let's you do things like this.

var time = 10.Seconds();

var distance = 10.Meters();

var speed = time / distance;

Console.WriteLine(speed); // 1[m/s]

As well as many other relationships for other units.
